				I spent the last 4 years working as a critical care nurse. While doing this,  I became involved with several task forces working with developers representing nursing interests. Itâ€™s here that I got a taste of software engineering and loved it. I enjoy coding, golfing, Elon Musk, the Green Bay Packers, and videogames. 
				%br
				Fun Fact: I dislike baseball.
